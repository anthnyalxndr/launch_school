# Day of Assessment Checklist
## Part 1: The Test
### Pre-Test Prep
- [ ] Set 5 different timers (see below).
	- [ ] 1 for 45 min. (1/4 through the test)
	- [ ] 1 for 1:30 min. (1/2 through the test)
	- [ ] 1 for 2:15 min. (3/4 through the test)
	- [ ] 1 for 2:50 min. (10 mins before the test ends)
	- [ ] 1 for 2:57 min. (3 mins before the test ends). Once this timer goes off just submit the test and live with the results (don't get a 10% penalty by going over time).

- [ ] Warm up with practice problem
	- [ ] CodeWars: 7 kyu or 8 kyu problems
	- [ ] LS: Medium or hard problems
	- [ ] LeetCode: Easy and Medium problems.
	
### During Test
- [ ] Start the test and start a stopwatch to check your pacing.
      
- [ ] Review all the questions to get a feel for the test and mark each question as easy (E) medium (M) or hard (H) in the question list below.
	- Pay attention to the point values and use that as a way to gauge difficulty
	  
- [ ] Go through the question answering checklist below
      **Question Answering Checklist**
	- [ ] Read questions CAREFULLY and ask yourself...
		- What does the question want me to do?
		- What knowledge is it testing?
		  
	- [ ] Do your best to give a succinct good answer in 5 min and then give it a quick review.
		- [ ] Give at least 1 example that demonstrates your understanding (giving 2 examples can be good if your having trouble finding the words to explain something).
	      
	- [ ] Test ALL code (even very trivial code). Make sure it runs in your editor.
		- [ ] ‚≠êÔ∏è With more complicated code, do not forget to create some (new) test cases, exhaustive (if possible) and covering edge cases.
	      
	- [ ] Format / preview answer
		- Preview your formatting to make sure it looks how it's supposed to
		- Format all mentions of valid JavaScript syntax as code by fencing them within single backticks.
	  
- [ ] Check your pacing vs the pacing table below
	- **Pacing Table**
		- Task                                                    | Duration      | Completed by
		  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
		  [ ] Initial Scan (read all questions)   | 5 min            | 00:05
		  [ ] Questions 1 - 5                              | 40 min          | 00:45
		  [ ] Questions 6 - 10                            | 40 min          | 01:25
		  [ ] Questions 11 - 15                           | 40 min          | 02:05

- [ ] Save your answers and mark their status as you work through them
	- Use the following system to keep track of which questions you've answered, partially answered, or skipped.
	  Answered = üü¢   |  Partial Answer = üü°  |  Skipped = üî¥  | Not Attempted = blank

- [ ] Remember the following best practices
	- Resist the temptation to be **too verbose** in your answers.
		- Remember that you‚Äôre communicating ideas to an actual person, not a robot
		  
	- Trust your knowledge and intuition
		- If you feel like you know something, trust that feeling, because the time you spend doubting what you know well will be better spent on things you don't know quite as well.
	  
	- Go in order but don‚Äôt get stuck
		- Don‚Äôt try to figure out the optimal order to answer the questions in. Remember: the goal is to answer all the questions.
		  
	- Be careful to not spend too much time on a particular question. 
		- If you notice that‚Äôs happening, write something correct but brief to secure yourself some points and come back to it at the end of the exam if you have time. 
		  
	- Skip questions you're unsure how to answer, don‚Äôt hesitate.
		- Come back to it at the end of the exam.
		- Many times you just need to divert your focus to then unravel a problem you are stuck on.

	- Stay calm
	
- [ ] If you experience any technical issues
	-   accidentally closing your browser, browser window, or browser tab
	-   power outages
	-   software failures
	-   other technical glitches
		
	you can easily recover your saved answers -- just reopen the exam. However, this only works for saved answers. Keep in mind the clock will continue to tick while you're trying to resolve the issues you encountered.
	
	If you experience any technical glitches that may be on our end, please take a screenshot if needed to show the problem, then reload the page in your browser. You can let us know about the problem¬†**after**¬†you submit the exam. (An immediate response via Slack or email is not guaranteed, so you're better off getting back to work as soon as you can.) You can add your note to the Conversation tab.

## Part 2: The Interview
Note: I can't look at any of the resources for the interview until I finish the assessment.
- [ ] Start a stopwatch when you begin solving a problem so you can keep track of time. Try and adhere to the following time-limit bench marks
	- [ ] Try to aim for having all examples and edge cases figured out by the 20 minute mark. Then try to get the algorithm finished up by the 30 minute mark.
