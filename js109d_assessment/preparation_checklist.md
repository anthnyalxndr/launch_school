# JS109 Assessment Prep Checklist
[Link to JS101d](https://launchschool.com/courses/804d1cae/home)

- [x] Finish going through [LS assessment reading](https://launchschool.com/lessons/cdfe3681/assignments) and add additional TODOs to checklist
      
- [ ] Keep the following in mind while studying. 
	- [ ] Distinctions
		- Be clear about the following distinctions:
			-   Parameters are the names assigned to a function's arguments; arguments are the values that get passed to the function.
			-   Variables are not passed to or returned by functions: **values** or **references** are passed.
			-   Truthiness vs Boolean values (see above)
			  
	- [ ] Precision of Language
		- It's important to be able to describe why something happens using precise vocabulary and be able to pinpoint the principle (scope, shadowing, etc.) at work. In other words, be precise and don't be vague.
		- 
	
	- [ ] Get to the point of feeling over-prepared
	
- [ ] Assessment Prep
	- [ ] Make a list of unclear topics as I go
	
	- [ ] Get 100% on the quizzes.
		- [ ] Read questions CAREFULLY and ask yourself...
			- What does the question want me to do?
			- What knowledge is it testing?
	
	- [ ] Read the lessons twice
	
	 - [ ] Do all Practice Problems at least once and time yourself while doing them. Try to do them in **under 8 minutes.** Make sure to use extremely precise language while doing problems.
		- [ ] Get my PEDAC process down pat while doing this.
		- [Small Problems](https://launchschool.com/exercises)
		- CodeWars
		- LeetCode
		- Structy
	
	- [ ] Do the following for all of the topics from the study guide below.
		1. Create your own quiz for each topic. Use Anki and tag each question with the appropriate topic - then filter for question in each topic and go through topics 1 at a time (Custom Study => study by card state or tag => Choose Tags)
			- Find practice questions relevant to each topic and paste them and their answers here.
				 - The idea is to have a nice template answer for each topic.
			 - Format the quiz in the same way the assessment will be formatted.
		2. Go through your quiz
			- Answer Format
				- Answer questions out loud as your writing the answers. 
				  
				- For each question, try to identify what's important concept, what requires a detailed explanation and what doesn't, and what examples you can use to make your answer clearer.
				  
				- Answer the questions in VSCode's markdown editor to simulate the LS Assessment experience.
				  
				- Practice answering each question in 8 min. or less with enough precision that it would pass the assessment.
				  
				- After you are done with an example, stop the timer and compare your answer with your template answer to make sure you are using the right language and haven’t forgotten to mention something important.
				 - Make a note of which questions took longer than the time you had allotted.
				   
				- If you go over 8 minutes, practice making your answers more succinct.
		
		3. Make a note of which topics are giving you trouble and make a plan to learn these topics better.
		   
		4. Summarize all the topics in my own words.
		   
		5. Be able to confidently explain all of the concepts on the study guide to someone else.
		   
		6. Repeat step 2 but get faster.
			- Without looking at any reference, answer your examples trying to be both precise and concise at the same time.
		- [ ] Topics
			- [ ] Test Taking Best Practices
				- [ ]   Read through student's general advice on taking the assessments
					- [ ]   In the video [How I Study and Prepare For Launch School's Assessments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NS1ar08blQk), Felicia describe's how she prepares for Launch School assessments, both exams and tests. This is an excellent video with advice that almost everybody can benefit from.
						  
						- [ ]   Zach had a rough time making his way through the first two Launch School assessments. In [I Failed Programming 101 Three Times](https://zachary-dubow.medium.com/i-failed-programming-101-three-times-6fa0ea487f64) his struggle and frustration trying to pass these assessments, and how he eventually embraced the Launch School way.
						
						- [ ]   Raúl talks about his preparation and experiences as a non-native English speaker in [this interesting article](https://medium.com/@raul.dehevia/launch-schools-109-written-assessment-a-non-native-english-speaker-s-perspective-d320b47368ba).
						
						- [ ]   Drew shares a [few tips](https://medium.com/launch-school/a-beginners-guide-to-surviving-launch-school-101-c706553252cc) to set you up for success and to make your Launch School journey a little less daunting.
						
						- [ ]   Dalibor wrote a [blog article](https://medium.com/launch-school/knowing-is-not-enough-you-need-tactics-too-how-to-be-prepared-for-launch-school-written-3f7b9c9cb08e) about his strategy for success on Launch School's written assessments.
						
						- [ ]   Callie's [blog article](https://medium.com/launch-school/passing-launch-schools-first-assessments-rb109-4b2b047060dc) has a wealth of useful information about preparing for both parts of the assessment: the exam and the interview. Callie speaks specifically of the Ruby-based RB109 assessments, but her advice and recommendations apply equally as well to JS109.
						  
					- [ ] Time Management
						- Read the following articles from students about time management on the assessment
							-   [The Importance of Time and Stress Management For Launch School Interviews](https://medium.com/launch-school/the-importance-of-time-and-stress-management-for-launch-school-interviews-20cb1b2fc92f)
							-   [How to prepare for Written Assessments and Manage your time while taking them!](https://medium.com/@haider.codes23/how-to-prepare-for-written-assessments-and-manage-your-time-while-taking-them-495ff01c37ca)
							  
							-  [Why I Ran Out of Time Taking Launch School’s RB109 Written Assessment (and what I’m changing so it doesn’t happen again)](https://medium.com/launch-school/why-i-ran-out-of-time-taking-launch-schools-rb109-written-assessment-and-what-i-m-changing-so-it-32a7eeb77b26)
						- There are approximately 20 questions on this exam
						  
						- As you're working through the assesssment practice time management to ensure you don't go over the time limit.
							- For example, with 20 questions in a 3-hour exam, you will need an average of 9 minutes for every question. If you spend 15 minutes per question, you will rapidly become pressed for time.
							  
						-  Take some time at the beginning of the exam to quickly review all of the questions so you can see which ones are going to require more time than the easier questions. 
							- This will give a better feel for how much time you can **really** devote to each question.
							  
						- Don't forget to leave a little time to review your answers.
						  
					- [ ] Coding best practices
						- Run your code often to check it.
						- Don't use a repl.
						
				- [ ] declarations, initialization, assignment, and re-assignment
				      
				- [ ] variable scope, especially how variables interact with function definitions and blocks
				      
				- [ ] primitive values, objects, and type coercions
				      
				- [ ] object properties
				      
				- [ ] mutability vs. immutability vs. `const`
				      
				- [ ] loose and strict equality
				      
				- [ ] passing arguments into and return values out of functions
					- Be **very** clear about the following when talking about functions.
						- Parameters are the names assigned to a function's arguments
						- arguments are the values that get passed to the function.
						- Variables are not passed to or returned by functions: **values** or **references** are passed.
				      
				- [ ] working with Strings
				      
				- [ ] working with Arrays, especially the iteration methods (`forEach`, `map`, `filter`, `find`, and `sort`)
				      
				- [ ] working with Objects; accessing keys and values of an Object as arrays
				      
				- [ ] arrays are objects
				      
				- [ ] understand the concepts of _pass-by-reference_ and _pass-by-value_
				      
				- [ ] variables as pointers
				      
				- [ ] console.log vs. return
				      
				- [ ] ⭐️ truthiness vs. boolean
					- the _falsy_ values `false`, `0`, `NaN`, `""`, `undefined`, and `null` are all said to _evaluate to false_ when used in a boolean context.
					- All other values, the _truthy_ values, are all said to _evaluate to true_
					  
				- [ ] function definition and invocation
				      
				- [ ] function declarations, function expressions, and arrow functions
				      
				- [ ] implicit return value of function invocations
				      
				- [ ] first-class functions
				      
				- [ ] side-effects
				      
				- [ ] naming conventions (legal vs idiomatic)
				      
				- [ ] Be able to explain what a function does without talking about its implementation; that is, document a function's use and purpose. (See below.)

	
	- [ ] Review necessary sections from the following resources.
		  Note: Go through the quizzes first to see how well you know the material from each section.
		- [ ] [Prep Course](https://launchschool.com/courses/6c70a040/home) 
		- [ ] [JS101](https://launchschool.com/courses/804d1cae/home)
		- [ ] [Introduction to Programming with JavaScript](https://launchschool.com/books/javascript)
	
	- [ ] Review all Anki cards
		- Don't do this until you've reviewed the LS material because you want to make sure that everything in Anki is correct.
		  
		- Start with JS109 Assessment deck
			- Potentially move tough cards into this deck temporarily.
		
		- Make sure the language  in the answers is extremely precise.
	
	- [ ] Attend study sessions (either via SPOT or [the Calendar](https://launchschool.com/events))
		- [ ] Come prepared with questions on all the topics you’re unsure about.
	
	- [ ] Find someone to study with
	
	- [ ] Review the [Assessment Rules](https://launchschool.com/lessons/cdfe3681/assignments/4d3c82ee)
	
	- [ ] Redo the blackjack problem without classes
	
- [ ] Interview Prep
	- [ ] Practice simulating the interview process
		- [ ] Answer questions and summarize material outloud
		      
		- [ ] Time yourself practicing questions
		      
		- [ ] Simulate an interview with a Launch School colleague.
			- Send eachother questions and ask each other to explain what the input of the question is, what the output of the question is, and why.
				- Answer the question in under 10 minutes and send the results back to each other.
				- Grade each other's responses using Launch School's curriculum and make an agreement to be totally honest (no flattery).
				  
		- [ ] Solve Problems in Front of Your Peers
			- Recreate the interview conditions: give your peer a problem they’ve never seen before. Time them. 
			- Have them talk through it in a professional and clear way. Once they finish, give them feedback on their communication and their code. 
			- Then they do it for you. [Kevin](https://github.com/kaymach) and I did this for hours on end. We mostly gave each other Codewars problems, which I recommend, too. 
			- Also, seek to study with more than one person, because you can learn so much from different people’s styles! I coded the most with Kevin (thanks for dealing with my incessant mic issues, pal), and also grew a lot from coding with [Leah](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leahgarrison) and [Felicia](https://twitter.com/hey_leasha). Don’t be afraid to reach out.
			  
		- [ ] Solve Leetcode, Codewars, and Structy problems for additional practice.
