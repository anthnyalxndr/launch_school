For the best results, take the following approach:

Break down each problem into smaller pieces. Decomposition of the problem is probably the most challenging and most important task since you first have to understand the problem well. Your first attempt may not lead to a good solution, so don't be afraid to start over.

Map the flow of the program in a flowchart, using sub-processes to encapsulate distinct components of the problem.

When you're ready to tackle a component or sub-process, write the pseudocode for that sub-process. The pseudocode will probably translate into one or more functions, so be sure you understand what your inputs and outputs will be.

Play around with the code. Write every line of code and make sure you understand it. Don't use copy and paste.

Do the assignments in sequence. We'll walk you through the necessary steps to break down the problem.

Don't be afraid to read the walk-throughs. Use them as guard rails so that you don't get stuck and spin your wheels for too long. However, don't sit back and read them without typing or coding along, either.
